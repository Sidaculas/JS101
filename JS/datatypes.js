// There are 6 Primitive data types in JavaScript:

// String, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint;
// String is a sequence of characters.
// Number is a number.
// Boolean is either true or false.
// Null is an empty value.
// Undefined is a value that has not been assigned a value.
// Symbol is a unique value.
// BigInt is a 64-bit integer.

// there are 3 variables in JavaScript:
// var, let, const
// var is a variable that can be reassigned. A variable can be declared with var, but it can also be declared with let or const.
// let is a variable that can be reassigned. it is a block-scoped variable, which means that it is available only within the block in which it is defined.
// const is a variable that cannot be reassigned. 


// objects created with const are immutable. but object values can be changed.
// For example, if we have a const object, and we want to change the value of a property, we can do so, but we cannot reassign the object itself. 

const obj = {a : 6};
obj.a = 7;
